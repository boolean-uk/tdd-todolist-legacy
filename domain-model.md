// Add your domain model below

1. Show only the first 20chars when displaying all items
- When seeing all the items, only show the first 20 chars of the item text, followed by '...'
- However, when displaying single items, show the whole item text.

2. To do items have dates when they were created.
- A user can search todo items by day and see a list of todo items by the day they were created.
- If there are no todos for that day, show an empty list
